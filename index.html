							<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
							<p><br>Link: https://www.seek.com.au/job/36889048?type=standard</br>
  
 

  
<br>The position is called IT Desk Analyst. There are few reasons that make this position appealing to me. Like I would be able to provide 1st level support and customer service, able to maintain centralized repository of documentation and process, able to diagnose reported problem etc. Besides others requirements I can easily learn.</br>

						<br>Skills/Qualification/Experience (for this position):
						<br>•	Excellent communication Skills.
<br>•	1-2 years experience in same role.
<br>•	Experience supporting and troubleshooting systems & networks- Wintel, Windows, Windows desktop, Active directory, PC & phone hardware, Microsoft office etc.</br>

<br>Skills/Qualification/Experience (what I have for this position):
<br>•	Regular participation in different social events has helped me to improve my speaking skills and engaging in conversations with people from all sorts of backgrounds. So I got pretty good communication skill.
						<br>•	I am pretty good in Microsoft word, excel, windows, windows desktop.<br>

<br>First of all, after finishing my bachelor degree I will look for some good jobs where I can get some initial experience for this role. It could be approximately 1 year. Secondly, I do not know much about some specific things for this job like wintel, hardware, Active directory. So my plan is to learn these skills during my studies. After getting these skills and 1 year of experience I will be able to apply for this role.

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<p>•	The result of online Myers-Briggs test- ESTJ (Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)
<br>•	The result of online learning-style test- Visual Learner (Auditory-30%, Visual- 50%, Tactile- 20%)
<br>•	Five-personality test result:<br>
1. Neuroticism was moderate at 58%, <br>
2. Openness was moderate 58%, <br>
3. Conscientiousness was high 71%, <br>
4. Extraversion was moderate 48%,<br> 
5. Agreeableness was moderate 62.5%.<br>
<br>• These results means a lot to me. This result is showing me where to develop and where to not.<br>
• I think these results will influence my behaviour in my team. Because I will push myself on those points where I should do good.<br>
• Basically I will obviously look for those people in my team who are better on those individual qualities I am behind. So that I can learn those skills that I need develop.
